!! How to Edit the Wiki

!!! Step 1: Make Your Changes

# Visit the wiki at https://anicolao.github.io/practical-copilot-wiki/
# Click the edit button (pencil icon) on any tiddler you want to modify, or create a new tiddler
# Make your desired changes using TiddlyWiki's markup language
# Edit multiple tiddlers if needed - all changes will be captured together

!!! Step 2: Submit Your Changes

When you're ready to submit your changes:

# Click the ''Submit Changes'' button (replaces the traditional red save button)
# A GitHub issue form will open with your changes pre-filled
# Review the changes captured in the issue
# Add a description of why you're making these changes
# Submit the issue

!!! Step 3: Wait for Review

# Maintainers will review your proposed changes
# They may ask questions or request modifications in the issue comments
# If approved, a maintainer will create a pull request from your changes
# You can preview the changes by visiting the PR preview link (if provided)

!!! Step 4: Changes Go Live

Once the pull request is merged:

# Your changes will be automatically deployed to the live wiki
# The wiki will be updated within a few minutes
# You'll be credited as a contributor in the commit history

!! What Gets Captured

When you click ''Submit Changes'', the system captures:

* All new tiddlers you created
* All modified tiddlers (showing before/after)
* Deleted tiddlers (if any)
* Timestamps and metadata

!! Tips for Success

* ''Be Clear'': Explain why you're making the changes in the issue description
* ''Be Focused'': Try to keep each submission focused on one topic or improvement
* ''Check Preview'': Review what's captured before submitting the issue
* ''Be Patient'': Maintainers review changes as quickly as possible

!! For Maintainers

When processing editing issues:

# Review the proposed changes in the issue
# Create a new branch from main
# Apply the changes from the issue
# Create a pull request
# Review the PR preview deployment
# Merge when satisfied
