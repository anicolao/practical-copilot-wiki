title: Editing Workflow
tags: Documentation Design

!! Overview

This document describes the proposed editing workflow for the Practical Copilot Wiki. Instead of the traditional TiddlyWiki approach where users download the entire HTML file when they save, we implement a GitHub-integrated workflow that enables collaborative editing while maintaining version control and review processes.

!! Motivation

The default TiddlyWiki save mechanism downloads a complete HTML file to the user's computer. While this works for personal wikis, it creates challenges for a collaborative, version-controlled wiki:

* Users cannot easily contribute changes back to the repository
* There's no review process for changes
* Multiple concurrent editors would create conflicting versions
* No audit trail of who made what changes

Our new workflow addresses these issues by integrating with GitHub's issue and pull request system.

!! High-Level Workflow

!! Benefits

* ''For Contributors'': Simple, familiar editing experience with clear submission process
* ''For Maintainers'': Review changes before integration, maintain quality control
* ''For Everyone'': Full audit trail, ability to preview changes, collaborative improvement

!! Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

* Automated processing of issue content to create PRs directly
* Integration with GitHub OAuth for authenticated editing
* Real-time collaborative editing features
* Automated testing of wiki content and links
