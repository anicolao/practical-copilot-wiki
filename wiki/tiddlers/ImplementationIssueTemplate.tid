!! GitHub Issue Template

To standardize wiki edit submissions, we create a GitHub issue template specifically for wiki edits.

!! Template Location

```
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/wiki-edit.md
```

!! Template Structure

```yaml
---
name: Wiki Edit
about: Submit changes to the wiki content
title: 'Wiki Edit: [Brief Description]'
labels: wiki-edit, needs-review
assignees: ''
---

## Summary

### New Tiddlers

<!-- List any new tiddlers created -->

### Modified Tiddlers

!! Field Mapping

When the wiki generates the issue URL, it maps changes to template sections:

* ''Title'': Auto-generated from changed tiddler names, user can edit
* ''Labels'': Automatically includes `wiki-edit` and `needs-review`
* ''Body - Changes section'': Populated with serialized tiddler diffs
* ''Body - Summary'': User fills in the web form
* ''Body - Additional Context'': User fills in the web form

!! URL Length Considerations

GitHub issue URLs have practical length limits. For large changesets:

* ''Option 1'': Truncate with message "Changes too large, see comment"
* ''Option 2'': Create empty issue and immediately post changes as comment via GitHub API
* ''Option 3'': Use a pastebin service and link to it
* ''Recommended'': Option 1 for simplicity, encourage focused edits

!! Label Workflow

Issues with the `wiki-edit` label follow this workflow:

# ''needs-review'': Initial state
# ''in-progress'': When a maintainer starts creating the PR
# ''preview-available'': When PR is created and preview deployment is ready
# ''approved'': When changes are approved
# Closed: When the PR is merged

!! Automation Opportunities

Future enhancements could include GitHub Actions that:

* Automatically parse the issue content
* Create a branch with the changes
* Open a pull request automatically
* Add a comment with the PR preview link
* Close the issue when the PR merges

For the initial implementation, this is handled manually by maintainers.

!! Example Issue
